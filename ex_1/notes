1. What is programming language?

A programming language is a formal language, which comprises a set of
instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are
used in computer programming to implement algorithms


2. What are different types of programming languages?

Programming languages are classified on two basis. First, they can be classified
according to their ..TODO.. Based on these classification there are following types
of languages:

    A. High level languages
    B. Assembly level languages
    C. Low level languages

Second, programming languages are classified on the basis of translation. On
this basis there are two types of languages:

    A. Compiled language
    B. Interpreted language


3. Give a brief introduction of C programming language.

C is a high level compiled programming language. It was developed by Dennis
Ritchie in AT&T Bell Labs while creating the UNIX operating system.


4. Briefly explain the compilation process of a programme written in C.

A. Pre processing step.
B. Translation from high level code to assembly code.
C. Translation from assembly code to binary code.
D. From step C we get object code of the program.
E. Object code is linked with library to get the executable program.


5. What is difference between software and firmware?


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Software                         | Firmware
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Software generally means a       | Firmware are also softwares but
computer program which has a     | they are used to do very low
specific task which is not       | level operations which are
necessarily related to proper    | closely related to proper
functioning of computer hardware.| functioning of computer hardware.
                                 |


6. What is difference between compiler and interpretor?

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Compiler                         | Interpretor
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Translates high level language   | Used to interpret instructions of 
to low level language.           | a program written in interpreted 
                                 | languages.
                                 | 
Needs to be run only once,       | Interpretor needs to run everytime
during the compilation process . | the program is run.
                                 |  
                                 |
Ex: C compiler, c++ compiler     | Python interpretor, PHP interpretor
                                 |


7. What is difference between system software and application software?

---------------------------------------------------------------------
System Software                  | Application Software
---------------------------------------------------------------------
System software are softwares    | Application softwares are softwares
which are needed for a computer  | which are used to perform specific 
to operate properly.             | operations which are not necessarily
                                 | needed for a computer to operate
                                 | properly.
                                 |
Computer may not work properly   | Computer will still work properly
if system softwares are missing. | even if some application softwares
                                 | are missing. 
                                 |
Ex: Operating system, loader,    | Ex: MS Word, Adobe Photoshop, FIFA, etc
    linker, etc.                 |
                                 |
